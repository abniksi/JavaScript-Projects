A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at https://codepen.io/abniksi/pen/qvabWX.

After creating an analog clock, I wanted to create a digital clock. Made some commits on the CodePen on what I could improve upon.

Used SASS for the first time in this project. Easy to use and enjoy it more than traditional CSS.
